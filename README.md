### Downloading Weights

TextOverlay uses the **U2Net** architecture. To download pre-trained weights, run:
You will be given two options:

u2net ‚Äì Full weights, recommended for most cases.

u2netp ‚Äì Lightweight version, faster but slightly less accurate.

Select the desired option to download the weights.
