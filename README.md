Downloading Weights

TextOverlay uses the U2Net architecture. To download the pre-trained weights, run:

python -m textoverlay.models.model_downloader list


You will be given two options:

u2net – Full weights, recommended for most use cases.

u2netp – Lightweight version, faster but less accurate.

Select the desired option to download the weights.
